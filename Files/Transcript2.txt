00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.790
David Dobervich (he/him): Hmm hmm hmm

2
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.300
David Dobervich (he/him): hmm

3
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.440
Bradley Scholten: Yo:

4
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.900
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay. So it Let's just remember what we had said. Um,

5
00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:04.549
David Dobervich (he/him): there. So there's no notes prior to the activity. Is that true?

6
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.570
David Dobervich (he/him): Wait, we said.

7
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.690
David Dobervich (he/him): What What did we say last time?

8
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.150
David Dobervich (he/him): Do you remember

9
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:22.049
Bradley Scholten: that you wanted to do something with um like? Here's like an observational study, and like, you know. And here's like an experiment

10
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.019
Bradley Scholten: like so like what's the difference in what we can conclude? Based off of these things.

11
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.659
Bradley Scholten: Um! And then sort of thinking about like what are

12
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.799
Bradley Scholten: what are some of the ways that,

13
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.540
Bradley Scholten: like It could go wrong in our conclusions, like what or some bad conclusions, or maybe like some.

14
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.739
Bradley Scholten: I'm guessing like basically the idea of like a lurking variable is kind of what

15
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.969
Bradley Scholten: we're sort of thinking about it as like.

16
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.799
Bradley Scholten: Why is an observational study? Not enough.

17
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.100
Bradley Scholten: Why do we have to do

18
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.930
Bradley Scholten: all the fun stuff for experiments?

19
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.480
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay?

20
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.560
David Dobervich (he/him): And we were hoping to get them to like. Name a lot of the potential sampling biases.

21
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.190
Bradley Scholten: Yeah,

22
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.679
Bradley Scholten: that's what the next video is. So

23
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.570
David Dobervich (he/him): okay,

24
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.080
David Dobervich (he/him): okay,

25
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.620
David Dobervich (he/him): uh,

26
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.790
David Dobervich (he/him): I think that's actually probably sufficient for me. I just wanted to like, remember what the context was. I should have written it down.

27
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.870
Bradley Scholten: So I made notes for biases.

28
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.730
Bradley Scholten: I just need to record the video, I stupidly left my ipad at home. So

29
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.870
David Dobervich (he/him): the notes in there.

30
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.270
Bradley Scholten: Yeah.

31
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.949
David Dobervich (he/him): Oh, yeah, I see him.

32
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.000
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay,

33
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:20.780
David Dobervich (he/him): alright, cool. Um, i'm gonna make a graphic organizer and make the activity and the activity we're giving. Starting tomorrow.

34
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.690
Bradley Scholten: Yes, okay,

35
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.220
David Dobervich (he/him): Cool

36
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.880
Bradley Scholten: uh you're gonna be out tomorrow, though.

37
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.230
Bradley Scholten: Yeah, I was gonna try to find like a Youtube video. That kind of

38
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.060
Bradley Scholten: maybe it goes over some of the

39
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.400
Bradley Scholten: you know key differences, and then they can jump into the thing you're making.

40
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.310
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay, i'll try and make it

41
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.759
Bradley Scholten: be less Teacher.

42
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.640
I mean, I think if I can find like the right video, that maybe kind of

43
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.290
Bradley Scholten: helps them out. Then it would be fine. But I yeah, I do need to know what it looks like. So that way I can sort of think about like

44
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.620
Bradley Scholten: what is some like pre-knowledge they would need before jumping into this.

45
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.750
David Dobervich (he/him): It's unlikely i'll be able to have a single example that will

46
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.189
David Dobervich (he/him): like have students elicit all the possible sample biases,

47
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:36.520
David Dobervich (he/him): so I don't know if i'll frame it as like. You want to do this kind of study, and here are different ways you have of thinking like, I guess, very similar to last year's

48
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:51.490
David Dobervich (he/him): uh sampling biases activity, because they seem to remember there were like several options. And we were saying, why the options were bad, or maybe I'm just imagining it. But anyway, that's I was just looking at it. It's the autonomous driver like self-driving cars like

49
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.090
Bradley Scholten: they pose a question like, Do you support autonomous vehicles, and then, like

50
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.789
Bradley Scholten: then they brainstorm all the bad ways to go about

51
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.650
Bradley Scholten: trying to collect data for that,

52
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.020
David Dobervich (he/him): right? So maybe i'll suggest

53
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.609
David Dobervich (he/him): all have like a bunch of fake suggestions like we could do this. We could do this. We could do this,

54
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.199
David Dobervich (he/him): and you can kind of like name what the problem with each one is.

55
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.139
Bradley Scholten: I like that.

56
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.570
David Dobervich (he/him): Um!

57
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.879
David Dobervich (he/him): And then maybe after that,

58
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.359
David Dobervich (he/him): maybe i'll keep that context. Or maybe i'll do a different context,

59
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.640
David Dobervich (he/him): because it would be nice to have one where

60
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.449
David Dobervich (he/him): we say, Oh, instead of doing an observational study. Let's do an experiment.

61
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:56.060
David Dobervich (he/him): Um i'll. I'll see if I can think of a single context that would do both. But if not, then the way it'll end after that is

62
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.899
David Dobervich (he/him): like, Why, why is an experiment generally better than an observational study?

63
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.199
David Dobervich (he/him): Given that it's better. Why, Don't, we always do it experiment? And Then there will be the graphic organizer.

64
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.530
Bradley Scholten: Yeah,

65
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:20.240
Bradley Scholten: that's good. Um. A context that I heard about was that one I forget which University did it, but they studied

66
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:34.069
Bradley Scholten: like five hundred Chinese children, and monitored their fish consumption and their Iq. And the study showed that children who ate more fish had higher Iqs.

67
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.369
Bradley Scholten: But there's obviously like a good Gillian lurking variables there.

68
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.830
David Dobervich (he/him): Okay? Uh, I think i'm going to get to work on it.

69
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.930
David Dobervich (he/him): Thank you.

70
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.000
Bradley Scholten: Feel better.
